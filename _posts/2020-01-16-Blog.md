As a maintainer of an online community, which is having a lot of  products where user gives a rating to products based on their  experience, then it is definite that at some point you have to find an  answer to questions like, how you are going to show the product on the  page based on filters i.e. like highest voted or lowest voted, etc.?<!--more--> Or  How can you rate a product based on upvotes and downvotes? How you can  give a score to a product which is rated on a K scale by users?

There are some ways you can find a score and rate products accordingly:

1. `Score = Average rating of products`
2. `Score = Positive rating - Negative rating`
3. `Score = Proportion of Positive ratings`

Evan Miller's famous blog [How not to sort](http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html), explains why  the above two scores are not good ways to rate the product or sort a product. 

Lower bound of **`Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter`** provides a way to sort a product based on positive and negative ratings.

The idea here is to treat the existing set of user ratings as a statistical sampling of a hypothetical set of user ratings from all users and then use this score. In other words, what user community would think about upvoting a product with 95% confidence given that we have an existing rating for this product with a sample (subset from the whole community) user ratings.

Therefore if we know what a sample population thinks i.e. user reviews for a product, you can use this to estimate the preferences of the whole community.

If there are `X` positive votes  and `Y` negative votes for a product and we want to understand how popular the product will be across the whole community. We can estimate that with 95% confidence between `wilson_lower_bound_score` and `wilson_upper_bound_score`% of users will upvote this product using Wilson Score of confidence interval.

### Wilson Score

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\fn_jvn&space;\left(\hat{p}&plus;\frac{z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}}{2&space;n}&space;\pm&space;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}&space;\sqrt{\left[\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})&plus;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}&space;/&space;4&space;n\right]&space;/&space;n}\right)&space;/\left(1&plus;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}&space;/&space;n\right)" />
 
 where,
    $$\hat{p}$$=`(# of positive ratings)/(Total ratings)` <br>
    $$n$$ `= Total ratings`<br>
    $$z_{α/2}$$= `quantile of the standard normal distribution`

```python
import math
import scipy.stats as st

def wilson_lower_bound(pos, n, confidence=0.95):
    """
    Function to provide lower bound of wilson score
    :param pos: No of positive ratings
    :param n: Total number of ratings
    :param confidence: Confidence interval, by default is 95 %
    :return: Wilson Lower bound score
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    z = st.norm.ppf(1 - (1 - confidence) / 2)
    phat = 1.0 * pos / n
    return (phat + z * z / (2 * n) - z * math.sqrt((phat * (1 - phat) + z * z / (4 * n)) / n)) / (1 + z * z / n)
```
Wilson Confidence Interval considers binomial distribution for score calculation i.e. it considers only positive and negative ratings. If your product is rated on 5 scale rating, then we can convert ratings {1-3} into negative and {4,5} to positive rating and can calculate wilson score.

Lets look at some examples:

1. If a product is rated across each category uniformly [10, 10, 10, 10, 10], i.e. 10 votes for rating {1-5},  then `wilson_lower_bound(20,50,.95), avg_rating([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) => (0.2760838973025655, 3.0)` 

2. A product receives only one rating i.e. positive and one product receives 10 positive and 2 negative ratings: in that case value of product having more ratings should be greater `wilson_lower_bound(1,1,0.95) < wilson_lower_bound(10,12,0.95)` , which is true.

3. Product having ratings A: (209 up and 50 down votes) and B: (118 up and 25 down) `wilson_lower_bound(209,259,0.95) < wilson_lower_bound(118,143,0.95)`

4. Suppose one product receives [5, 10, 20, 0, 0] ratings, then `wilson_lower_bound(0,35,0.95) = 0`, If any product  does not have any positive ratings associated with it then the Wilson score is zero.

5. Wilson Score can not be applied to new product which is yet to receive any rating, if using above implementation `wilson_lower_bound(0,0,0.95) = 0`. 

   Wilson score gives us the zero value for both the product which does not received any positive user rating and to product which is new and yet to receive any rating, which essentially does not make any sense as this implies **no user rated product** is same as **product having lower ratings**. Also, it is not clear how tight the lower bound is i.e., how far it deviates away from the “real” proportion of thumb-ups [1]. It does not seem intuitive to convert items rated on five star scale to convert to up votes and down votes for calculating scores to follow binomial distribution.
   
##  Bayesian Approximation

**Bayesian Approximation** provides a way to give a score to product when they are rated on star scale.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\fn_jvn&space;\large&space;\left(\hat{p}&plus;\frac{z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}}{2&space;n}&space;\pm&space;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}&space;\sqrt{\left[\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})&plus;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}&space;/&space;4&space;n\right]&space;/&space;n}\right)&space;/\left(1&plus;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}&space;/&space;n\right)" title="\large \left(\hat{p}&plus;\frac{z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}}{2&space;n}&space;\pm&space;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}&space;\sqrt{\left[\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})&plus;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}&space;/&space;4&space;n\right]&space;/&space;n}\right)&space;/\left(1&plus;z_{\alpha&space;/&space;2}^{2}&space;/&space;n\right)" />

where, $$s_k=k$$ (That is, 1 point, 2 points, ….) <br>
      $$N$$ = total ratings, with $$n_k$$ ratings for $$k^{th}$$ scale
 
 The above expression provides the lower bound of a normal approximation to a Bayesian credible interval for the average rating. For more mathematical details please check [4].
```python
import math
import scipy.stats as st

def bayesian_rating_products(n, confidence=0.95):
    """
    Function to calculate wilson score for N star rating system. 
    :param n: Array having count of star ratings where ith index represent the votes for that category i.e. [3, 5, 6, 7, 10]
    here, there are 3 votes for 1-star rating, similarly 5 votes for 2-star rating. 
    :param confidence: Confidence interval
    :return: Score
    """
    if sum(n)==0:
        return 0
    K = len(n)
    z = st.norm.ppf(1 - (1 - confidence) / 2)
    N = sum(n)
    first_part = 0.0
    second_part = 0.0
    for k, n_k in enumerate(n):
        first_part += (k+1)*(n[k]+1)/(N+K)
        second_part += (k+1)*(k+1)*(n[k]+1)/(N+K)
    score = first_part - z * math.sqrt((second_part - first_part*first_part)/(N+K+1))
    return score
```

Lets look at some test samples

1. `bayesian_rating_products([0, 0, 0, 0, 1]) = 2.2290`

2. `bayesian_rating_products([0, 2, 0, 10, 0]) = 2.9921`

3. `bayesian_rating_products([5, 10, 20, 0, 0]) = 2.2349`

4. `bayesian_rating_products([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) = 2.6296`

   On comparing 1 and 2, we can observe the second product should have a higher score and that is the case here. Also in point 3, unlike Wilson score it provides a score to the product which does not have a positive rating and still that score is greater than the first product which seems reasonable to me.

   Bayesian Approximation does not consider only upvotes unlike Wilson's  score but considers ratings across the K scale and proves to be better  in this scenario.
