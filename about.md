I am currently a Senior ML Scientist at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/), specializing in solving complex problems in the security domain. At Snowflake, I’ve worked on the LLM Gateway for RAG-based applications to mitigate AI-driven threats, developed large-scale anomaly detection systems for beaconing detection and port scanning, designed and developed a data quality program for security data sources, and implemented real-time ML system monitoring. My focus is on building scalable ML systems, securing LLM applications, and optimizing inference at scale

I am particularly interested in solving challenges that arise when ML systems operate at scale. My expertise includes real-time monitoring of ML models, large-scale anomaly detection, evaluating ML systems in production, and deploying efficient models for high-throughput environments. Additionally, I work on ranking and optimization problems to improve system performance and decision-making.

At Snowflake, I have led the development of:

- LLM Security Gateway, a real-time security layer for RAG-based applications, preventing prompt injection, PII leaks, unauthorized code execution, and adversarial attacks.
- Anomaly detection in VPC flow logs (~12-15B events per hour), improving security incident response time and reducing false positives.
- A proactive data quality monitoring system, ensuring schema consistency, data reliability, and real-time anomaly detection across Snowflake’s infrastructure.

Before Snowflake, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [Spiceworks](https://swzd.com/), where I built real-time ML models for programmatic ad bidding (RTB), personalized email targeting, and NLP-driven insights extraction.

Previously, at DBS Bank, I developed time-series forecasting models to optimize ATM cash demand prediction across Singapore, improving operational efficiency.
