I am currently working as Data Scientist at [Spiceworks](https://www.spiceworks.com/), focusing on problems 
related to Natural Language processing. Previously, with DBS Bank I was primarily working on 
cash forecasting of ATMs using Time Series forecasting models.

Prior to that I have completed my masters degree in Software engineering from [IIIT-Allahabad.](https://www.iiita.ac.in/)
