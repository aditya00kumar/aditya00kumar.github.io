I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Spiceworks](https://www.spiceworks.com/), focusing on problems 
related to Natural Language processing. Previously, with [DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page) I was primarily working on 
cash forecasting of all ATMs in Singapore using Time Series forecasting models.

I have completed my masters degree in Software engineering from [IIIT-Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/) and a graduate degree in computer science from the University of Rajasthan.
