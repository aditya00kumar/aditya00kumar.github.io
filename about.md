I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/), where my work involves anomaly detection in large-scale data. I am interested in solving problems that arise from ML systems operating at a scale. Monitoring the ML systems in real-time, evaluation of models/system, development, and deployment of ML models to serve at a large scale, ranking of results are some of the problems that I find interesting.

Before joining Snowflake, I worked as Senior Data Scientist at [Spiceworks](https://www.spiceworks.com/) having an experience in building large-scale Machine Learning systems focusing on problems related to Real-Time bidding (RTB) for Ads, ML models for targeting users for Email Campaigns, and some problems related to NLP. 

Previously, with [DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page) I have worked on cash forecasting of all ATMs in Singapore using Time Series forecasting models.

I have completed my master's degree in Software engineering from [IIIT-Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/) and a graduate degree in computer science from the University of Rajasthan.
